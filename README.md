# Carbonite Webscraper

This project stemmed from an inspiration from a book called "Automating the boring stuff with Python", a long time desire to get into web scrapping and to gain a competitive edge on a second-hand South African Tech platform called Carbonite. Good deals are almost always snatched up within minutes of being posted and requires you to be informed of your PC every minute; a commitment not everyone can make.

Plus with all the data collected, who knows, there might be some insights to be gained. #DataAnalytics
